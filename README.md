# State Machines Talk - Laracon 2023
Thanks so much for your interest in my State Machines talk.

Know that this codebase should be used as a reference only and not as a working prototype. There are a good number of places in this codebase that provide non-implemented pseudo-code examples for your reference. 

Please use this only as a way to remember what the ideas discussed during the talk were.

The main locations to pay attention to are:

- `app/Http/Controllers/*`
- `app/StateMachines/Invoice/*`
- `app/Enums/*`
